# JennyDevelops
Portfolio site 2022

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript - A personal landing page showing off my latest portfolio projects and providing contact information for anyone searching for freelance web development help.

**Link to site:** https://jennydevelops.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

My learning in this project was based upon combining overlayed images and backgrounds in a way that allowed the information to flow over a picture from one of my favorite hiking trails. Media Queries were tweaked so the site will perform well on mobile as well as desktop sized screens.

## Optimizations

Animation and large images originally slowed down the loading of my site significantly. Reducing file sizes greatly helped to speed up loading of my homepage, and improved the lighthouse scores.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about working with floats to ensure that elements were positioned correctly.
